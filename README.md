# DiRT-RallyCross-times-PyQt5-

This little python projet is just beginning. I would like to create a small program to record your RallyCross lap times in DiRT Rally 2.0. 

You will be able to select the track your ran, submit your best lap time, and then the program will take you to your personnal leaderboard. 

It is fairly simple, but this project's main goal is for me to learn and practice creating GUIs in Python.

I would like to add more functionality down the line, such as being able to add more details to the context of your lap, and analyze the data to look for trends in what variables help in completing a faster lap.
